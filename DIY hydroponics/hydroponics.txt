Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture, the method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.
Terrestrial plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to the mineral solution, or the roots may be supported by an inert medium, such as perlite or gravel. 
The nutrients in hydroponics can be from fish waste, duck manure, or normal nutrients.


Techniques
There are two main variations for each medium, sub-irrigation and top irrigation. 
For all techniques, most hydroponic reservoirs are now built of plastic, but other materials have been used including concrete, glass, metal, vegetable solids, and wood. 
The containers should exclude light to prevent algae growth in the nutrient solution.
